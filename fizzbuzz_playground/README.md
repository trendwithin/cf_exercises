Fizzbuzz_Playground

First a quick anectdote.  At a recent RB Monthly Meet-Up there was an hour+
long presentation about job interview best practices from both perspectives.
During the ensuing Q&A one of the more respected voices in the community
quipped "If they ask you to code FizzBuzz walk out the door."  Well, I have
no intentions of walking out the door, however given that this is the first
assignment for CF and I'm not walking out the door, I decided to do some research
on FizzBuzz.

In my research I came across dozens of solutions and quickly realized my
initial approach to this while practical, was flawed.  There was quite a bit
of repetition, so I focused on code by others that was readable while reducing
redundancy and fired up IRB to pracice examples that made the most sense to me.

In the process of my research I came across the site rubyquiz.com which has proven
to be quite informative and instructive with practical real world examples to hone
one's skill set.

So, for this first assignment I'll be standing on the shoulders of others as
there are more eloquent solutions than my original implementation using if/else.
